## Analysis 1 - Tail numbers per year

As the first analysis I will get the number of tail numbers for each year.

```{r}
planes %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(year) %>% 
  print(n=47)
```
## Analysis 2 - Average seat numbers per manufacturer

As the second analysis I will get average number of seats per plane per manufacturer.

```{r}
planes %>% 
  filter(!is.na(seats)) %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>% 
  summarise(avg_seats = round(mean(seats),2)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_seats)) %>%
  print(n=Inf)
```
